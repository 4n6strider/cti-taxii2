<p>Members of the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/cti/">OASIS Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) TC</a> create and manage technical content in this TC GitHub repository ( <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/cti-taxii2">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/cti-taxii2</a> ) as part of the TC's chartered work (<i>i.e.</i>, the program of work and deliverables described in its <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/cti/charter.php">charter</a>).</p>

<p>OASIS TC GitHub repositories, as described in <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/tcadmin/github-repositories-for-oasis-tc-members-chartered-work">GitHub Repositories for OASIS TC Members' Chartered Work</a>, are governed by the OASIS <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process">TC Process</a>, <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr">IPR Policy</a>, and other policies, similar to TC Wikis, TC JIRA issues tracking instances, TC SVN/Subversion repositories, etc.  While they make use of public GitHub repositories, these TC GitHub repositories are distinct from <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories">OASIS Open Repositories</a>, which are used for development of open source <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/licenses">licensed</a> content.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The purpose of this public GitHub repository is to support development and maintenance of assets associated with chartered TC "Taxii 2" deliverables within the OASIS CTI Technical Committee. This <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/taxii/">TAXII</a> repository may contain official specification documents along with wikis and issues relating to the official specifications.</p>

<p>TAXII is an application layer protocol for the communication of cyber threat information in a simple and scalable manner. The TAXII specification defines the TAXII RESTful API and its resources along with the requirements for TAXII Client and Server implementations.</p>

<p>TAXII is specifically designed to support the exchange of CTI represented in <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/">STIX</a> (Structured Threat Information Expression). As such, the examples and some features in the specification are intended to align with STIX. This does not mean TAXII cannot be used to share
data in other formats.  It is designed for STIX, but is not limited to STIX.</p>
